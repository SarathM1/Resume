Create Machine learning algorithms that predict the age and SOC of the battery cell. Creating a GUI and test-suite for the project}
  
  \projects{2018-2019}{Lidargen}{The objective of the project was to create a tool that would simulate the actual output from a LIDAR sensor. The tool takes three dimensional CAD objects as input and generates corresponding pointcloud. The User is given the freedom to place and orient the multiple meshes to create a virtual scenario}{To mathematical model the behavior of Lidar and simulate the same using Ray Casting. Designing a Qt based user interface.}
  
  \projects{2017 - 2018}{UAV Based Driver View Enhancement}{To develop a proof of concept, using a Drone to enhance the view of the Driver and cover blind spots for a larger area around the vehicel}{Designing a State Machine to control the Drone, Create a web application as a User interface using Python as a backend}

%Demonstrate what an \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}} page looks like.
%Also show off the macros for publications that uses small icons for authors, date, journal and links.

%Achieving a good looking spacing can be tricky. For empty pagestyles where the full width is available use \texttt{\textbackslash pubforcefullwidth} to force the publoication list to take up all the available space.
%The (relative) lengths reserved for date, journal and links can be set with the parameters \texttt{\textbackslash pubdatelength}, \texttt{\textbackslash pubjournallength} and \texttt{\textbackslash publinklength} as in \texttt{\textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash pubdatelength\}\{0.15 \textbackslash linewidth\}}.
